# Malcom 🚀

Welcome to **Malcom**! This project is designed to provide a standardized framework for performing website audits. Named in honor of Malcom Baldrige, a proponent of quality management, Malcom centralizes metadata and audit structures to ensure consistency and high-quality assessments across various audit types.

## Features ✨

- **Centralized Metadata**: Malcom centralizes all audit metadata, ensuring consistency across different audit implementations. 🎉
- **Extensible Audit Framework**: Easily create new audits by extending the core `AuditBase` class and importing standardized metadata. 🔥
- **Modular Design**: Each audit type can be implemented in its own repository, reducing redundancy and simplifying maintenance. 🌟

## Installation 💻

You can install the package via pip (if published), or clone the repository and install it locally:

```bash
pip install malcom-core
```

## Usage 📚

Here's a quick example to get you started with an audit implementation:

```python
from malcom.core_audit import AuditBase
from malcom.metadata.architecture_metadata import ARCHITECTURE_METADATA

class RobotsTxtAudit(AuditBase):
    def __init__(self):
        metadata = ARCHITECTURE_METADATA["presence_of_robots_txt"]
        super().__init__(
            name=metadata["name"],
            importance=metadata["importance"],
            measurement_criteria=metadata["measurement_criteria"],
            fix_methods=metadata["fix_methods"],
            use_cases=metadata["use_cases"]
        )

    def run(self, website):
        print(f"Running {self.name} on the website: {website}")
        if "robots.txt" in website:  # Simplified example check
            self.passed = True
        else:
            self.passed = False
            self.issues.append("robots.txt file is missing.")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    audit = RobotsTxtAudit()
    website_data = {"robots.txt": False}  # Example website data
    audit.run(website_data)
    print("Audit passed:", audit.get_result())
    print("Issues:", audit.get_issues())
```

## Running Tests 🧪

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
# or
